# How To Use

- Copy everything from `Shaders/` into your shaders folder
- Copy everythin from `Textures/` into your textures folder
- Copy `ReShadePreset.ini` into your custom presets folder for ESO

**Warning:** You will need to override (or, if you are not comfortable with that, rename) `MultiLUT.fx` in the shaders directory, since GShade doesn't come with the LUT I'm used to from ReShade.
